        <p class = "text2" id = "about"> I'm a sophomore at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science in McCormick (the engineering school). 
            I am also hoping to get a certificate in Managerial Analytics from Kellogg. <br>
            <br>
            I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina and then moved 6 times before finally ending up in Evanston. <br>
            <br>
            On campus, I am involved with the Northwestern Robotics Team, the Men's Ultimate Frisbee team and the Triathlon team. 
            I have additionally founded a start-up that helps provide CS services to other budding startups, students in the Northwestern 
            community or anyone else in need of technical consulting services. The aim for the students working in the startup is to 
            gain experience on real world projects that will help them find CS jobs/internships.
