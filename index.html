            <p class = "text"> This is part of a project my brother and I completed over the summer - a facial recognition box. 
                Using a modified version of Carnegie Mellon's OpenFace neural network, when the camera in the box detects a 
                known face, the lock on the box opens. What you see in this image is the raspberry pi, arduino and step motor 
                used to for the hardware of the box. Here <a href = "https://github.com/niraj7shah/facial-recognition">

                <p class = "text"> In my Design Thinking and Communication class, my team and I were tasked to create something that could 
                    help people with disabilities get in and out of the recumbent trikes that they were using for therapy. 
                    We decided to focus on portability and sturdiness for the design, and came up with a folding design 
                    that comes apart to be smaller than a suitcase, but still sturdy enough to help the users achieve their goal 
                    of independently entering and exiting the trike. My team and I won the design award for the class.
